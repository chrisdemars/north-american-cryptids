## What is a Cryptid?
According to Bernard Heuvelman in the book, [Cryptozoology A to Z: The Encyclopedia of Loch Monsters, Sasquatch, Chupacabras, and Other AUthentic Mysteries of Nature](https://a.co/d/b6RQvno), Cryptozoology is, "The scientific study of hidden animals, i.e., of still unknown animal forms about which only testiomonial and circumstantial evidence is available, or material evidence considered insufficient by some!"
